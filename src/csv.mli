      field with leading or trailing spaces or a leading '0' will be
      encoded as ="..."  (to avoid Excel "helping" you).  Default:
      [false].  *)

val to_channel : ?separator:char -> ?excel_tricks:bool ->
  Pervasives.out_channel -> out_channel
  (** Same as {!Csv.to_out_obj} but output to a standard channel. *)

val to_buffer : ?separator:char -> ?excel_tricks:bool ->

  (** Print the CSV data. *)

val print_readable : t -> unit
  (** Print the CSV data to [stdout] in a human-readable format.  Not
      much is guaranteed about how the CSV is printed, except that it
      will be easier to follow than a "raw" output done with
      {!Csv.print}.  This is a one-way operation.  There is no easy way
      to parse the output of this command back into CSV data.  *)

val save_out_readable : Pervasives.out_channel -> t -> unit
  (** As for {!Csv.print_readable}, allowing the output to be sent to
      a channel.  *)


(************************************************************************)
(** {2 Functions acting on CSV data loaded in memory} *)

val lines : t -> int
  (** Return the number of lines in a CSV data. *)

val columns : t -> int
  (** Work out the (maximum) number of columns in a CSV file.  Note
      that each line may be a different length, so this finds the one
      with the most columns.  *)

val trim : ?top:bool -> ?left:bool -> ?right:bool -> ?bottom:bool -> t -> t
  (** This takes a CSV file and trims empty cells.

      All four of the option arguments ([~top], [~left], [~right], [~bottom])
      default to [true].

      The exact behaviour is:

      [~right]: If true, remove any empty cells at the right hand end of
      any row.  The number of columns in the resulting CSV structure will
      not necessarily be the same for each row.

      [~top]: If true, remove any empty rows (no cells, or containing
      just empty cells) from the top of the CSV structure.

      [~bottom]: If true, remove any empty rows from the bottom of the
      CSV structure.

      [~left]: If true, remove any empty columns from the left of the
      CSV structure.  Note that [~left] and [~right] are quite different:
      [~left] considers the whole CSV structure, whereas [~right] considers
      each row in isolation.
   *)


val square : t -> t
  (** Make the CSV data "square" (actually rectangular).  This pads
      out each row with empty cells so that all rows are the same
      length as the longest row.  After this operation, every row will
      have length {!Csv.columns}.  *)

val is_square : t -> bool
  (** Return true iff the CSV is "square" (actually rectangular).
      This means that each row has the same number of cells.  *)

val set_columns : cols:int -> t -> t
  (** [set_columns cols csv] makes the CSV data square by forcing the
      width to the given number of [cols].  Any short rows are padded
      with blank cells.  Any long rows are truncated.  *)

val set_rows : rows:int -> t -> t
  (** [set_rows rows csv] makes the CSV data have exactly [rows] rows
      by adding empty rows or truncating rows as necessary.

      Note that [set_rows] does not make the CSV square.  If you want it
      to be square, call either {!Csv.square} or {!Csv.set_columns}
      after.  *)

val set_size : rows:int -> cols:int -> t -> t
  (** [set_size rows cols csv] makes the CSV data square by forcing
      the size to [rows * cols], adding blank cells or truncating as
      necessary.  It is the same as calling [set_columns cols
      (set_rows rows csv)] *)

val sub : r:int -> c:int -> rows:int -> cols:int -> t -> t
  (** [sub r c rows cols csv] returns a subset of [csv].  The subset is
      defined as having top left corner at row [r], column [c] (counting
      from [0]) and being [rows] deep and [cols] wide.

      The returned CSV will be "square".  *)

val compare : t -> t -> int
  (** Compare two CSV files for equality, ignoring blank cells at the
      end of a row, and empty rows appended to one or the other.  This
      is "semantic" equality - roughly speaking, the two CSV files
      would look the same if opened in a spreadsheet program.  *)

val concat : t list -> t
  (** Concatenate CSV files so that they appear side by side, arranged
      left to right across the page.  Each CSV file (except the final
      one) is first squared.

      (To concatenate CSV files so that they appear from top to
      bottom, just use [List.concat]).  *)

val transpose : t -> t
(** Permutes the lines and columns of the CSV data.  Nonexistent cells
    become empty cells after transpose if they must be created. *)

val to_array : t -> string array array
val of_array : string array array -> t
(** Convenience functions to convert to and from a matrix
   representation.  [to_array] will produce a ragged matrix (not all
   rows will have the same length) unless you call {!Csv.square}
   first.  *)

val associate : string list -> t -> (string * string) list list
(** [associate header data] takes a block of data and converts each
    row in turn into an assoc list which maps column header to data cell.

    Typically a spreadsheet will have the format:
    {v
      header1   header2   header3
      data11    data12    data13
      data21    data22    data23
      ...
    v}
    This function arranges the data into a more usable form which is
    robust against changes in column ordering.  The output of the
    function is:
    {v
      [ ["header1", "data11"; "header2", "data12"; "header3", "data13"];
        ["header1", "data21"; "header2", "data22"; "header3", "data23"];
        etc. ]
    v}
    Each row is turned into an assoc list (see [List.assoc]).

    If a row is too short, it is padded with empty cells ([""]).  If
    a row is too long, it is truncated.

    You would typically call this function as:
    {[
    let header, data = match csv with h :: d -> h, d | [] -> assert false;;
    let data = Csv.associate header data;;
    ]}
    The header strings are shared, so the actual space in memory consumed
    by the spreadsheet is not much larger.
  *)

val map : f:(string -> string) -> t -> t
(** [map f csv] applies [f] to all entries of [csv] and returns the
    resulting CSV. *)
