(** [of_in_obj ?separator ?excel_tricks in_chan] creates a new "channel"
    to access the data in CSV form available from the channel [in_chan].
    Note that data is read on a as-needed basis by the functions {!next},
    {!fold_left},... so the channel must stay open while these functions
    are executed.  When you are done with the channel, call {!close_in} to
    close it.

    @param separator What character the separator is.  The default is
    [','].  You should be aware however that, in the countries where
    comma is used as a decimal separator, Excel will use [';'] as the
    separator.

    @param strip Whether to remove the white space around unquoted
    fields.  The default is [true] for backward compatibility reasons.

    @param has_header tells that the first row of the CSV channel is
    to be interpreted as a header (this row will not be returned by
    {!next}).  This is useful to use the functions in the {!Rows}
    module below.  Default: [false].

    @param header Supply the header to use for this CSV channel.  If
    both [header] and [has_header] are given, the names of [header]
    take precedence; if a name in [header] is [""], the one in the CSV
    header is used.  If a name appears twice, only its first
    occurrence is used.

    @param backslash_escape Whether to allow \", \n,... in quoted
    fields.  This is used by MySQL for example but is not standard CSV
    so it is set to [false] by default.

    @param excel_tricks enables Excel tricks, namely the fact that '"'
    followed by '0' in a quoted string means ASCII NULL and the fact
    that a field of the form ="..." only returns the string inside the
    quotes.  Default: [true].

    @param fix Parses the CSV data without raising the exception
    [Csv.Failure].  If the data does not conform to the CSV format
    (e.g. because of badly escaped quotes), try to repair it.

      the column does not exist. *)

  val find : t -> string -> string
  (** [find row header] return the value of the colum labelled with
      [header] (or [""] if no such header has been declared).  *)

  val to_list : t -> string list
  (** [to_list row] convert [row] to the usual representation, the
      list being in the column order. *)

  val to_assoc : t -> (string * string) list
  (** [to_assoc row] return an associative list of the row data as
      [(header, value)].  If no header is given for a column, [""] is
      used. *)

  val with_header : t -> string list -> t
  (** [with_header row h] return the [row] with headers [h].  If a
      name in [h] is [""], the name present in [row] is used.  If a
      name is duplicated. *)
end

(** Accessing rows (when a header was provided). *)
module Rows : sig
  val header : in_channel -> string list
  (** The header declared for this channel.  *)

  val set_header : ?replace: bool -> in_channel -> string list -> unit
  (** [set_header ic headers] set the new header for all {i
     subsequent} reads on [ic] (previously read {!Row.t} values are
     unaffected).  This is useful for example to compose an unusual
     header after reading several lines of the CSV data.

     @param replace When [false] (the default), if an entry in
     [headers] is [""], the previous name (if any) is kept (see the
     [header] parameter of {!of_in_obj}).  When [true], an entry [""]
     means there is no access by name for that column. *)

  val next : in_channel -> Row.t

(** {2 Functions acting on CSV data loaded in memory} *)

val lines : t -> int
  (** Return the number of lines in a CSV data. *)

val columns : t -> int
  (** Work out the (maximum) number of columns in a CSV file.  Note
      that each line may be a different length, so this finds the one
      with the most columns.  *)

val trim : ?top:bool -> ?left:bool -> ?right:bool -> ?bottom:bool -> t -> t
  (** This takes a CSV file and trims empty cells.

      All four of the option arguments ([~top], [~left], [~right], [~bottom])
      default to [true].

      The exact behaviour is:

      [~right]: If true, remove any empty cells at the right hand end of
      any row.  The number of columns in the resulting CSV structure will
      not necessarily be the same for each row.

      [~top]: If true, remove any empty rows (no cells, or containing
      just empty cells) from the top of the CSV structure.

      [~bottom]: If true, remove any empty rows from the bottom of the
      CSV structure.

      [~left]: If true, remove any empty columns from the left of the
      CSV structure.  Note that [~left] and [~right] are quite different:
      [~left] considers the whole CSV structure, whereas [~right] considers
      each row in isolation.
   *)


val square : t -> t
  (** Make the CSV data "square" (actually rectangular).  This pads
      out each row with empty cells so that all rows are the same
      length as the longest row.  After this operation, every row will
      have length {!Csv.columns}.  *)

val is_square : t -> bool
  (** Return true iff the CSV is "square" (actually rectangular).
      This means that each row has the same number of cells.  *)

val set_columns : cols:int -> t -> t
  (** [set_columns cols csv] makes the CSV data square by forcing the
      width to the given number of [cols].  Any short rows are padded
      with blank cells.  Any long rows are truncated.  *)

val set_rows : rows:int -> t -> t
  (** [set_rows rows csv] makes the CSV data have exactly [rows] rows
      by adding empty rows or truncating rows as necessary.

      Note that [set_rows] does not make the CSV square.  If you want it
      to be square, call either {!Csv.square} or {!Csv.set_columns}
      after.  *)

val set_size : rows:int -> cols:int -> t -> t
  (** [set_size rows cols csv] makes the CSV data square by forcing
      the size to [rows * cols], adding blank cells or truncating as
      necessary.  It is the same as calling [set_columns cols
      (set_rows rows csv)] *)

val sub : r:int -> c:int -> rows:int -> cols:int -> t -> t
  (** [sub r c rows cols csv] returns a subset of [csv].  The subset is
      defined as having top left corner at row [r], column [c] (counting
      from [0]) and being [rows] deep and [cols] wide.

      The returned CSV will be "square".  *)

val compare : t -> t -> int
  (** Compare two CSV files for equality, ignoring blank cells at the
      end of a row, and empty rows appended to one or the other.  This
      is "semantic" equality - roughly speaking, the two CSV files
      would look the same if opened in a spreadsheet program.  *)

val concat : t list -> t
  (** Concatenate CSV files so that they appear side by side, arranged
      left to right across the page.  Each CSV file (except the final
      one) is first squared.

      (To concatenate CSV files so that they appear from top to
      bottom, just use [List.concat]).  *)

val transpose : t -> t
(** Permutes the lines and columns of the CSV data.  Nonexistent cells
    become empty cells after transpose if they must be created. *)

val to_array : t -> string array array
val of_array : string array array -> t
(** Convenience functions to convert to and from a matrix
   representation.  [to_array] will produce a ragged matrix (not all
   rows will have the same length) unless you call {!Csv.square}
   first.  *)

val associate : string list -> t -> (string * string) list list
(** [associate header data] takes a block of data and converts each
    row in turn into an assoc list which maps column header to data cell.

    Typically a spreadsheet will have the format:
    {v
      header1   header2   header3
      data11    data12    data13
      data21    data22    data23
      ...
    v}
    This function arranges the data into a more usable form which is
    robust against changes in column ordering.  The output of the
    function is:
    {v
      [ ["header1", "data11"; "header2", "data12"; "header3", "data13"];
        ["header1", "data21"; "header2", "data22"; "header3", "data23"];
        etc. ]
    v}
    Each row is turned into an assoc list (see [List.assoc]).

    If a row is too short, it is padded with empty cells ([""]).  If
    a row is too long, it is truncated.

    You would typically call this function as:
    {[
    let header, data = match csv with h :: d -> h, d | [] -> assert false;;
    let data = Csv.associate header data;;
    ]}
    The header strings are shared, so the actual space in memory consumed
    by the spreadsheet is not much larger.
  *)

val combine : header: string list -> string list -> (string * string) list
(** [combine ~header row] returns a row with elements [(h, x)] where
    [h] is the header name and [x] the corresponding row entry.  If
    the [row] has less entries than [header], they are interpreted as
    being empty.  See {!associate} which applies this function to all
    rows. *)

val map : f:(string -> string) -> t -> t
(** [map f csv] applies [f] to all entries of [csv] and returns the
    resulting CSV. *)
